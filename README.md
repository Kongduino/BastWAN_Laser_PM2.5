# BastWAN_Laser_PM2.5

A project demonstrating I2C capabilities of the BastWAN.

It requires 1 library:

* [`Seeed_HM330X`](http://librarymanager/All#Seeed_HM330X) by SeeedStudio for the HM3301 Laser PM2.5 sensor.

Nothing particular with this code: just checking that it works. I provided my `hexDump` function to pretty-print the data from the sensor.
